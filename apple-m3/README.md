# Comparing OS and libraries on Apple M3

The directory contains results for `aesbench` on the Apple M3 chip with various
operating systems and different versions of the cryptographic libraries.

The test environment is one single iMac M3 with the following configurations:

- Host macOS 15.3 and OpenSSL 3.4.1 (installed by Homebrew).
- VM Linux Ubuntu 24.10 and OpenSSL 3.3.1 (installed with Ubuntu).
- VM Linux Ubuntu 24.10 and OpenSSL 3.4.1 (recompiled from sources).

The hypervisor is Parallels Desktop 20.2.0.

Observations:

- The macOS version is marginally better by less than 1%. We may assume that the code
  which is generated by clang on macOS is slightly better than using gcc on Linux.
- There is a more important difference on AES-GCM.
