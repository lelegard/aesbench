# Build files for Windows and comparison with BCrypt

The directory contains the Visual Studio project files to build `aesbench` on
Windows systems. It also contains the source code of `aesbench-bcrypt`, an
equivalent of `aesbench` using the Microsoft cryptographic library named
"BCrypt", also known as CNG (Cryptography API Next Generation). BCrypt is
included in the base Windows system and is available everywhere.
