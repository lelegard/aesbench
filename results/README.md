# Results on various processors and operating systems

On Intel CPU's, the frequency varies a lot. For tests on Linux virtual machines,
the frequency is monitored during the test, from the Windows host, using the
[HWINFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/) tool. The frequency is permanently adjusted
and it is difficult to get a precise value. The value which is used here is an
estimated average.

Average monitored frequency during the test:
- i7-8565U : 4.2 GHz
- i7-13700H : 5.0 GHz
